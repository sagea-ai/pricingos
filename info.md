“PRICING OS — Your Revenue Intelligence Copilot”

Context:

Meet Santosh. He’s the founder of UptrendHR — a Nepali SaaS startup offering HR automation tools for SMEs across South Asia. He’s bootstrapped, burned out, and stuck at $5K MRR. His churn is rising, and he’s unsure if it's the product, the price, or the market.

Like many SaaS founders in Nepal, Santosh faces tough challenges:

- 🇳🇵 No access to pricing consultants or seasoned growth leaders
- 🧠 Limited behavioral or usage data to inform packaging decisions
- 💸 Reliance on gut-feeling to price (often undervaluing product)
- 📉 Poor visibility into unit economics, churn dynamics, or LTV
- 🌏 Operating in fragmented, price-sensitive emerging markets

💡 That’s where Pricing OS comes in.

USER STORY — How Santosh Uses Pricing OS

1. 🎯 Santosh signs up and creates an organization: "UptrendHR"
2. 🧾 He fills out the onboarding:
    - Product Name: UptrendHR
    - Core Value: "Automated attendance, payroll & HR ops"
    - Features: "Shift scheduling, payroll exports, Nepali calendar integration"
    - Market: "B2B SaaS for South Asian SMEs"
    - Current Pricing Model: Flat tiers ($9/user/mo)
    - Current Price: $99/mo flat
    - Payment Integration: Connects Khalti + Stripe
3. 📊 He’s taken to the Intelligence Dashboard — and now things get real:
    
    ✳️ Feature-to-Value Mapping:
    
    - “You offer Shift Scheduling + Nepali Calendar + Attendance API”
    - “Competitor A charges $50/mo for only Attendance”
    - “You may be underpricing by 2–3x for your value”
    
    🔁 Pricing Model Fit:
    
    - “Your flat model may not serve small clients with <5 employees”
    - “Consider a hybrid model: $20 base + $2/user — suggested by churn profiles + feature usage”
    
    🆚 Competitor Matrix:
    
    - Clear table comparing UptrendHR to India-based competitors (Zoho People, Kredily)
    
    🧪 A/B Test Simulator:
    
    - Santosh tests: “What if Nepali Calendar becomes a paid add-on?”
    - Predicts a 12% revenue lift among enterprise users with low churn risk
    
    📈 SAGE Card:
    
    - “Recommended: Tiered pricing with Core, Pro, Enterprise”
    - Reasoning: “80% of users only use attendance + payroll — bundle rest as add-ons”
    - Transparency: SAGE explains trade-offs using bidirectional reasoning
4. 💵 In the Finances Tab:
    - Pulls data from Khalti + Stripe → visualizes cash runway, monthly revenue, MRR growth
    - Sees a warning: “You have <4 months runway. Raising prices or cutting CAC can extend it to 9.”
5. 📥 Action Panel:
    - Instantly generate updated pricing page HTML
    - Send pricing change email template to users
    - Export investor brief on pricing changes + revenue impact

Why It Wins:

- 🧠 It’s not just ChatGPT. It’s strategy, simulation, and storytelling in one.
- 🔎 Every recommendation is backed by real-world data + SAGE reasoning.
- 🌐 For under-resourced founders in Nepal, this replaces a $20K pricing consultant.
- 💸 Improves pricing → extends runway → improves survival odds.

How This Ties Together:

- Intelligence Dashboard: Diagnosis + Ideas
- SAGE Engine: Justification + Explanation
- Simulator: Safe experimentation
- Finances Tab: Validation via cash flow
- Outputs: Actionable exports for stakeholders

Final Closing Line (optional, for the pitch stage):

"Pricing OS is not a wrapper — it’s what a strategic pricing team, a finance analyst, and a growth advisor would look like if they lived inside your dashboard. In Nepal and beyond, we're not just building a tool — we’re helping founders like Santosh survive, grow, and thrive."
